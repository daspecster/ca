    <h2>How it works!</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Send us as many details about your future car as you can!</li>
      <li>We'll give you some information about the car or class of car you're searching for and possibly ask a few more questions.</li>
      <li>Once you've pointed us in the right direction, we'll search our approved dealerships and contacts to find your car!</li>
      <li>Lastly, we encourage you to rate your dealer and car to help other car lovers out there!</li>
    </ol>

  <div id="why">
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>We love to see people love their cars! We found that our experience at car dealerships wasn't unique to our friends.
      It's rare to find a car dealership that has salesman that really know a lot about the cars they're selling. It's also
      rare to find salesmen that want to get you in a car you'll love even if it's not on their lot at that moment.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Our goal is to put you in a car that you'll fall in love with and connect you with dealerships that genuinely want to help you.</strong></p>
